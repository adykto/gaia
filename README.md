Prototype World Generator in Haxe+Flixel
----------------------------------------

gaia is a work-in-progress world generator I made earler in 2014, and am submitting to PROCJAM (http://itch.io/jam/procjam). I hope it's of use to people. Right now it requires HaxeFlixel but I'll try and remove this dependency for future versions. I'm hoping to expand it with civilisations in the near future, but other projects will probably get in the way somewahat.

Usage
-----
R - Regenerate entire world 
Q/W - Raise/lower water level
A/S - Raise/lower plains limiter
Z/X - Raise/lower hills limiter
O/P - Alter the 'smoothness' of the generated worlds (Press R to regenerate after changing this option)

Notes on the Generator
----------------------

Hi! My name's Mike and I like making procedural stuff. This is my first stab at doing
world generation in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Ultima Ratio Regum - I'm hoping
that one day it'll form the basis of a usable, open source world generation tool.

However, right now it's rough and experimental and really just a code-based dump of
my brain. It has hacked code, old code, unused code, no comments, and is more or less
not for consumption. You're welcome to peruse though!
