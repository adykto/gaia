Prototype World Generator in Haxe+Flixel
----------------------------------------

Usage
-----
R - Regenerate entire world (a little graphically buggy due to some legacy code)

Notes on the Generator
----------------------

Hi! My name's Mike and I like making procedural stuff. This is my first stab at doing
world generation in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Ultima Ratio Regum - I'm hoping
that one day it'll form the basis of a usable, open source world generation tool.

However, right now it's rough and experimental and really just a code-based dump of
my brain. It has hacked code, old code, unused code, no comments, and is more or less
not for consumption. You're welcome to peruse though!
